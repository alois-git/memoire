Use wireshark on console :

tshark -i interface -w filename

Or use tcpdump and do :

tcpdump -i interface -w mycap.cap 
tcpdump -s0 -i any -w /tmp/name.pcap (-s0 for the linux cooked format for mptcptrace)

tcpdump -n -B 4096 -s0 -i any -w /tmp/name.pcap (set buffer to 4096 and dismiss dns request)

Than analyse with wireshark

MPTCP trace generate csv and xplot file the subflow are numerated from 0 to n but in the csv and xplot file they are in reverse order : 1 = n

also apply prepareDotsOnly on all the csv and then use appropriate script ./sequence ./gput depending on the kind of csv (kind = file name)
